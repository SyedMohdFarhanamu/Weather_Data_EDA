# Weather_Data_EDA
Hi Everyone,

 I have been working with Estes Park Weather data and performing EDA and stuck with some questions. Please help me out on how to get the following.

 * 1 - What is the standard deviation of maximum winds peed across all the days.
 * 2 What is the difference between 50th percentile and 75th percentile of average temperature
* 3 What is the pearson's correlation between average dew point and average temperature
* 4 Out of all the available records which month has the lowest average humidity
(Assign your answer as month index, for example if its July index is 7)
* 5 Which month has the highest median for maximum_gust_speed out of all the available records.
Also find the respective value
( hint: group by month)
* 6 Determine the average temperature between the months of March 2010 to May 2012 (including both the months)
* 7 Find the range of average temperature on Dec 2010
* 8 Out of all available records which day has the highest difference between maximum_pressure and minimum_pressure
(assign the date in string format as 'yyyy-mm-dd'. Make sure you enclose it with single quote)
* 9 How many days falls under median (i.e equal to median value) of barometer reading
* 10 Out of all the available records how many days are within one standard deviation of average temperature
